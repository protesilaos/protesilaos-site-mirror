## About protesilaos.com

I have been posting content on [protesilaos.com](/) since February 2011. This is the platform that presents in an organised and meaningful way all of my intellectual work. It is at the epicentre of all I do in terms of thinking, writing, and coding: a major content hub, hosting over 500 articles and featuring a growing number of publications on several fronts.

This website has evolved considerably over the years. It started off as a simple blog on Blogger, turner into a self-hosted WordPress site, and now exists as a set of files that are transformed into static pages with Jekyll. The [source code](https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/protesilaos.gitlab.io) contains only the latter and only since I moved hosting from GitHub to GitLab.

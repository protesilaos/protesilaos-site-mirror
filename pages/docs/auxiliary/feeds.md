There are two types of regular updates on this website. Each has its own feed, as it caters to a different audience.

**Blog on European Union politics**  
[https://protesilaos.com/feed.xml](/feed.xml)

**Coding blog about web development and GNU/Linux**  
[https://protesilaos.com/codelog.xml](/codelog.xml)

## What is a feed anyway?

It is a stream of data that is read by a specialised application, a feed reader (try out [feedly](http://feedly.com/)). The feed is updated every time the website pushes some new piece of content. In my case that would be a new article. What you will receive in your reader is the title of my new piece plus a short excerpt.

To subscribe to either of the above feeds, just copy their respective link and paste it in your reader's "add new" option (the exact method varies, so search your own app's approach).

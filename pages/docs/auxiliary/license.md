## Undelying code base

This website is my creation. Its [source is open](https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/protesilaos.gitlab.io) to public scrutiny. All original text and code relevant to it partake of the aforementioned provisions.

### Colours

The current theme is part of [Prot16](/schemes/): my collection of colour schemes for styling websites and highlighting code syntax in an extended number of applications.

*The label "Prot16" is a play on my nickname and [Chris Kempson's Base16](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16) project*.

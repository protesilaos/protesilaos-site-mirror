## Scope of collaboration

As an independent agent (freelancer), I provide services in both of my fields of expertise, namely, (i) European Union politics and economics, (ii) front end development for small scale websites.

### What I am willing to do

1. **Politics.** Provide expert analysis and opinion on EU affairs.
  - Work individually or as part of a research team.
  - Write an op-ed or policy brief on a given area of policy.
2. **Code.** Develop a highly-performant, content-focused website using Jekyll.
  - Start from scratch or use one of my existing templates.
  - Deliver a bespoke colour scheme for the theme of the website as well as for highlighting code syntax.

### What I will not do

1. Be part of a narrowly partisan cause or pressure group.
2. Deal with a CMS, such as WordPress, or a framework like Bootstrap.

### Priority

Offers are accepted on the basis of my availability and their relevance to my overall work.

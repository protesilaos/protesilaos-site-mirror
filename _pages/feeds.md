There are three types of regular updates on this website. Each has its own feed, as it caters to a different audience.

**Blog on European Union politics**  
[https://protesilaos.com/feed.xml](/feed.xml)

**Coding blog about web development and GNU/Linux**  
[https://protesilaos.com/codelog.xml](/codelog.xml)

**Πολιτικές αναλύσεις στα ελληνικά (political writings in greek)**  
[https://protesilaos.com/greek.xml](/greek.xml)

## Meta feed (not recommended as default)

There also exists a 'catch-all' feed which includes every single update to this website, such as new books, new colour schemes, etc.

**Master feed for protesilaos.com**

## What is a feed anyway?

It is a stream of data that is read by a specialised application, a feed reader (try out [feedly](http://feedly.com/), though there are others as well). The feed is updated every time the website pushes some new piece of content. In my case that would be a new article. What you will receive in your reader is the title of my new piece plus a short excerpt.

To subscribe to any of the above feeds, just copy their respective link and paste it in your reader's "add new" option (the exact method varies, so search your own app's approach).
